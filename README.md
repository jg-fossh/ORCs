# ORCs
Open-source RISC-V Cores

## ORC R32I
Open-source RISC-V Core riscv32i implementation directory. Contains the source code, simulation files and examples for synthesis and place-and-route.

## Tools
Collection of tools for compiling, synthesizing, building, simulating and verifying the implementations. **A recursive GIT clone takes about 7GB of disk space.**

## To Do
This project is currently under progress it uses previous work from the DarkRISCV project (https://github.com/darklife/darkriscv) as a starting reference. The ORC_R32I is yet to be verified and benchmarked. The code synthesizes, which provides a reference on possible FPGA resource usage and clock rates.
